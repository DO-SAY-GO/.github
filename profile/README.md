### FAQ

**Why is the name spelled differently?**

Funny story. The OG name was "DOSAYGO" (most common verbs in many languages besides "to be" as companies have no business telling you who "to be" but should help you with other stuff like "do" "say" "go"!). But on the company incorporation documents the "Y" and "A" letters became transposed. Serendipitous? Maybe. But anyway it was left like that for a few years, until recently we started using the OG name more prominently.
