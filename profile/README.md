### **What's in a Name?**
Originally named "DOSAYGO," reflecting common action verbs in various languages, our name symbolizes our mission: helping you "do," "say," and "go" in the digital world. However, a small mix-up during incorporation led to the quirky spelling "DOSYAGO," which we've embraced as part of our unique identity. Now, we proudly use both names as a nod to our roots and our journey.
